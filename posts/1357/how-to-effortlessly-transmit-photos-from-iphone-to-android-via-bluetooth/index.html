With the help of this guide, you can quickly and safely share photos with loved ones, colleagues, and beyond. By the end of this guide, you will know how to efficiently and effortlessly share your photos from your iPhone to your Android device.\nAccording to Android Authority, the most efficient way to transfer photos from iPhone to Android via Bluetooth is by using a file transfer app like Send Anywhere. This app allows users to transfer files up to 400 MB, and it is available for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. The highly-rated app also offers the highest data security and promises to keep your files safe.\nAccording to Apple Insider, the easiest way to transfer photos from an iPhone to an Android device is via Bluetooth. By pairing the two devices together, you can effortlessly send photos within seconds. Moreover, many manufacturers have their own file-sharing applications that allow you to transfer images very quickly; for example, the ‘Xperia Transfer Mobile’ from Sony.\nAccording to CNET, if your Android device doesn’t have a file-sharing app pre-installed, then the best option is to use an online service like Google Photos. This service allows users to easily transfer photos from iPhone to Android devices by simply signing into their Google account. Moreover, it is very secure and allows you to store your photos in the cloud for later viewing.\nGuide To Transfer Photos Between iOS and Android Devices Using Bluetooth\nTransfer Photos via Bluetooth Step 1: On your iPhone, open the Photos app and select the photos you wish to send.
