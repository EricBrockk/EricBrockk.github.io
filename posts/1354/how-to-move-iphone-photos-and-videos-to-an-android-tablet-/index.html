Here’s how:\nConnect your iPhone to your computer with the appropriate cable, and open iTunes.\nIn iTunes, click on your device name located in the upper right corner.\nClick on “Photos” from the left menu.\nSelect the “Sync Photos” option.\nClick the checkbox next to the folder on your computer that contains the photos you want to transfer.\nClick “Sync” to save the photos onto your computer.\nDownload Google’s “Android File Transfer” application onto your computer.\nConnect your Android tablet to your computer with the appropriate cable.\nLocate the folder on your computer containing the photos you want to transfer and copy it.\nOpen the Android File Transfer application.\nPaste the folder into the Android File Transfer window.\nDisconnect your tablet, and your photos will now be saved on it.\n1. Overview of the Process of Moving Photos and Videos from iPhone to Android Tablet Firstly, make sure that you have both the Lightning cable or charging cable for your iPhone and the USB cable for your Android tablet ready. Then, open the iTunes program on the computer and connect your iPhone to it using the Lightning cable. Once your iPhone is connected, it should automatically sync with iTunes.

Finally, select the “Photos” option and check the box next to “Sync Photos from” and then choose the folder on your computer that contains the photos and videos that you would like to transfer. Your photos and videos should now be transferred to your Android tablet.\n2. Preparing iPhone and Android Tablet for Data Transfer Start by connecting your iPhone to your computer with the appropriate cable. For iPhone 7 and later models, use the USB-C to Lightning Cable.

Open iTunes on your computer and click on your device name in the upper right corner. Select the “Photos” option on the left side of the window. Under the “Copy Photos From” drop down menu, choose your iPhone as the source device, and your Android tablet as the destination device. Click “Done” to begin the data transfer. The process may take several minutes. Once complete, open your Android tablet to view the resulting photos and videos. 3.
