Are you feeling anxious about updating your Android from version 9 to 12? Worry no more! We’ve got tips to make sure your transition is smooth and error-free. Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems, and its updates are essential to keeping your device secure and running smoothly. But sometimes the update process can be tricky, and you may end up making mistakes that can cause you more trouble down the road. In this article, we will explore how to avoid common mistakes when updating your Android device from 9 to 12. We will cover the common pitfalls, tricks, and tips to help make the updating process easier and more efficient. So, let’s get started!\nMake sure to back up all your data before upgrading your Android OS. Research from SafeSwap Online suggests that many Android users simply do not back up their data before upgrading their OS, leaving them vulnerable to data loss.\nResearch the new features available in the update. As pointed out by tech expert Jesse Singh, “It’s important to know what new features are added in the update you are upgrading to, and to decide whether they are worth the time and effort it will take to undertake the upgrade.”\nTake extra precaution when downloading and installing the update. According to the Android blog, it is important to keep an eye out for any malicious software or apps that may try to trick you into downloading something other than the official Android upgrade.\nWhat You Need to Know Before Updating Your Android Version from 9 to 12 Step by Step Guide to Updating Android Version 9 to 12\nUpgrade Android 9 to 12 Check the available storage space. Ensure that your device has enough storage space to receive the update. If needed, free up additional space by deleting unnecessary files and apps. Back up your data. Before you install the update, make sure to back up your data in case something goes wrong. Transfer data like photos, music, videos, contacts and other important files to the cloud, an external hard drive or other storage device. Download the correct update. Download the update that is specifically intended for your device model. Otherwise, you could end up with a bricked device. Get the update directly from the manufacturer. To avoid any potential bugs and malware, only download the update from the manufacturer’s website. Read the update release notes. Make sure to read the full update release notes before starting the update. This will give you a general idea of the types of changes and bug fixes the update contains. Over the air (OTA) vs. Manual. While both methods are available, OTA is often more reliable. Generally, the device will check for available updates periodically and alert you when one is available. Prepare for an update. Ensure that your device has enough power to complete the installation, and connect to a stable Wi-Fi connection if available. Disable anti-virus or anti-malware programs. These types of programs can interfere with the update process. So, disable them temporarily until the installation is complete. Do not interrupt the process. Should the process fail, you may require special software or hardware recovery tools to restore your device. It is essential that the update process is not interrupted in any way. Test the device. After the update, make sure to test the device to ensure that it is functioning properly and all features are working correctly. 1. Understand the Upgrade Requirements It is important to understand the requirements for updating your Android from version 9 to 12. Before attempting the update, check the storage space available. Make sure there is enough for the update to process. If not, delete any unnecessary files or apps to make room for the update. Next, back up any data stored on the device. Ensure that data is safely stored on the cloud or an external storage device as a precaution before the update is applied. Finally, ensure the device is connected to a reliable and secure internet connection before beginning the update.\n2. Backup Data Before Upgrading Before upgrading it is important to check storage space and free it up by deleting unnecessary files and apps. It is also important to back up data for safety’s sake as upgrading can cause data loss. Transferring data to external storage or cloud storage can help to ensure that important data is not lost during the upgrade to Android 12. Another good habit to ensure easy updates is to keep your smartphone clean by deleting apps that are not used, clearing out caches and other system temporary files.\n3. Uninstall Unnecessary Apps Before updating your Android device to version 12, it is important to check your storage space and make sure there is enough for the update. To free up more space, consider deleting any unnecessary apps and files to make room for the update. It is also advisable to back up your data onto the cloud or an external storage device to avoid any loss of data during the update process. Uninstalling apps that you do not use on a regular basis can also free up lots of memory and help you get ready for the update.\n4. Test Your Upgrade for Issues It is essential to have a good and stable internet connection when updating. Check the device’s signal strength or switch to Wi-Fi connection. When downloading and installing the upgrade, be aware of possible data charges. Try to also make sure that the device’s battery is charged more than 50% or possibly connected to a power source.\nFurthermore, have the latest version of Google Play services installed on your device as this service will facilitate the latest updates as well as functioning of all the Google Apps on the device. To check if there is a new version available, select the ‘My Apps’ tab in the Play Store and check if any of them needs an update.\nIn addition, after downloading the update, observe if the device is functioning smoothly. Take extra precaution to notice any incompatibility between old and newly installed apps, and also check if all data has been backed up correctly. Furthermore, try to confirm if the security apps such as antivirus or malware protection are updated as well.\nIt is also important to ensure that any downloaded additional software, such as graphics, sounds or themes, are backed up and stored properly. Try to deactivate these before upgrading to the new version as it may cause errors and glitches when installing.\nLastly, be aware of the device’s security after the upgrade. Try to update security apps such as malware protection and antivirus, as the new version of the OS might have different security protocols. Also, use two-factor authentication when accessing important accounts like email or bank accounts.\nQ1 : What are some common mistakes to avoid when updating Android from version 9 to 12? A1: Common mistakes to avoid when updating Android from version 9 to 12 include forgetting to back up all relevant data, not taking the necessary security measures, overlook updating the drivers and firmware, neglecting to check compatibility of apps prior to updating, and not freeing up space on the device.\nQ2 : How important is it to back up your information before updating? A2: It is extremely important to back up your information prior to updating your Android from version 9 to 12. Taking a backup ensures that you will not lose any important files, documents, photos, or videos should an issue arise during the update.\nQ3 : What safety measures should be taken before updating to the new version? A3: Before updating to the new version of Android, it is important to scan the device for malware and viruses, ensure that the battery is fully charged, and download and install all relevant system and security updates.\nQ4 : What should I do to ensure compatibility with apps after updating? A4: To ensure compatibility with apps after updating your Android to version 12, you should be sure to check that any apps you will be using are compatible with version 12. If an app is not compatible, users should look for a newer version of the app or uninstall it to avoid any issues.\nQ5 : What should be done if the device does not have enough storage to update to version 12? A5: If the device does not have enough storage to update to version 12, users should free up space on the device by uninstalling unnecessary apps and storing important data and files on an external storage drive or cloud storage service.
