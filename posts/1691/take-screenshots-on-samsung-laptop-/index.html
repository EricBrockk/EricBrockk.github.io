Make sure all the information is present on the display and everything looks the way you want it to be.\nOpen the Snipping Tool Next, you will need to open the snipping tool. This is a Windows 10 in-built feature and it is available in the Start Menu. Click on the ‘Start’ menu and type ‘Snipping Tool’ in the search bar.
