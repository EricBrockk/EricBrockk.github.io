Check the import source as the .VCF file you saved earlier, then you can start importing. Analyze the information and either merge or replace old contacts with new ones. Finally, if you are using a Samsung phone, you should go to the contacts app, select ‘Contacts to Display’, check the box ‘All Contacts’ and click ‘Done’.</p><p>It is important to keep your contacts up to date and secure, so use a secure network like a VPN or a trusted Wi-Fi connection when transferring data. Also, make sure to keep your contacts organized by categorizing them as family, friends, co-workers, etc. This will make it easier to access them in the future. It is also important to keep your contacts backed up in case of any unexpected losses. You can do this by keeping them synced with online data managers or by manually creating a backup.</p><p>Although transferring contacts from iPhone to Android is quite simple with the aforementioned steps, it is still important to be cautious and utilize best practices. Before starting the transfer process, make sure to create a backup of your contacts. Additionally, always use a secure network for data transfer, and ensure that your contacts app is synced with online data managers. Lastly, keep your contacts organized and regularly back up your contacts to avoid any data loss.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUzXl_xQ_ns style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is the simplest way to move my contacts from an iPhone to an Android phone?
