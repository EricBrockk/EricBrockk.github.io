Are you looking for an easier way to migrate contacts from your old iPhone to your new Android device? In this article, we will explain how you can transfer your contacts from iPhone to your new Android device without losing any data. Whether you’re looking to switch from iOS to Android for the first time, or if you’re just looking to upgrade your existing device, we’ll walk you through the process step-by-step. We’ll also provide tips and tricks for making the transition as smooth as possible. Let’s get started!\nAccording to a recent survey by the International Data Corporation (IDC), one of the most common tasks that people face when switching from an iPhone to an Android device is how to migrate their contacts without losing any data.\nFortunately, there are several easy ways to do this. The most commonly used methods are Google Contacts, iCloud, or using third-party software.\nGoogle Contacts can be used to sync contacts with an Android device. All you have to do is sign in to your Google account on both your iPhone and Android device and your contacts will be automatically synced. iCloud can also be used to transfer contacts, by exporting contacts from your iPhone and then importing them to your Android device. Finally, third-party software such as Dr.Fone, iSkysoft, and Wondershare can be used to transfer contacts from iPhone to an Android device with a few simple clicks.\nStep by Step Guide to Easily Transfer Contacts from iPhone to Android Transfer Contacts Guide Step 1: Connect iPhone to Computer Connect your iPhone to the computer with a USB cable and select “Trust” when prompted.\nStep 2: Install the MobileTrans App Download and install the iSkysoft MobileTrans app from the official website.

This includes connecting your iPhone and Android device to a computer, downloading and installing the iSkysoft MobileTrans app, and launching the app to select “Phone to Phone Transfer” from its main window. After these steps have been completed, you will be able to transfer the contacts from your iPhone to your Android device, ensuring that all the contact information is kept intact. Additionally, make sure that both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network prior to initiating the transfer process. This will help the transfer progress more quickly and avoid any interruption due to a weak internet connection.

After the transfer is completed, you will get a notification that all the contacts have been transferred to the Android device.

During the process, you will be able to see a prompt of the transferring process. Once complete, click on “OK” to end the data transfer process. Then, you can disconnect both phones from the computer. Your contacts should now be migrated from iPhone to Android.\n4. Verify the transferred contacts After you connected your devices and selected the transfer type, you will see the contacts from your iPhone listed on the left side and contacts from the Android phone on the right side. You can select the contacts you want to migrate and click Start Transfer. Once the process is done, you have to verify that the contacts have been migrated successfully. In the process, all your contact details such as contact numbers, pictures, contact notes, and email address are transferred without any data loss. On the iPhone device, open the Contacts app and check to make sure all your contacts have been transferred to the Android phone.
