The update brings a number of essential features such as enhanced security, improved performance, and a wide variety of bug fixes.\nIn addition, Samsung recommends taking proactive steps to maintain device stability such as backing up data, clearing out unused apps, and resetting permissions.

This includes any photos, videos, music files, documents, contact information, or other types of data stored on your phone. The easiest way to do this is to create a backup of your data on Google Drive, which can be done by going to the Settings section of your Samsung device and selecting the option to back up your data.\nStep 2: Check Device Compatibility Before proceeding with the update, you should ensure your device is compatible with Android 12. To do this, go to the About Phone section of your device’s Settings menu and look for the Android Version. If your device is running an older version of Android (prior to Android 11), it may not be compatible with the new update.\nStep 3: Download the Update Once you have verified that your device is compatible, the next step is to download the update. To do this, open the Samsung Software Update app on your device and select the option to download the update. Make sure you have a strong internet connection and enough storage space available on your device before beginning the download.\nStep 4: Install the Update After the download has finished, it’s time to install the update. To do this, open the Samsung Software Update app and select the option to install the update. The installation process may take a few minutes, so make sure you have a full battery and are connected to a reliable source of power.\nStep 5: Verify the Installation Once the installation is finished, it’s important to verify that the update was properly installed. To do this, open the Settings menu on your device and go to the About Phone section. Here, you should be able to find the Android version of your device, which should indicate that you have successfully updated to Android 12.\n1. Overview of Android 11 and 12 Android 11 is the latest version of the popular mobile operating system, offering improved features, performance, and security. On the other hand, Android 12 is set to bring many new exciting features and an improved UI. Before updating your Android device to the latest version, it is important to ensure that your device is stable and secure. Therefore, it is essential to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the update can be completed without any issues. To maintain stability while updating your Samsung device from Android 11 to Android 12, here are some suggestions.\nFirst, make sure that you have enough storage space on your device to complete the update. The Android 12 update requires more storage space than the Android 11 update, so make sure you have enough room for it. Additionally, make sure that all the apps and services on your device are up to date. This will ensure that they are compatible with the new Android version and will reduce the risk of any malfunctions.\nSecond, perform a factory reset of your device before updating to Android 12. This will ensure that all the problematic apps and services are removed and won’t interfere with the update process. Make sure to back up all your files and data first since the reset will erase everything on your device.\nThird, make sure to disable any third-party applications that may conflict with the update process. These applications may interfere with the update process and cause the update to fail, so it’s best to disable them. Additionally, disable any “overclocking” or optimization of your device as this could also interfere with the update.\nFourth, make sure your device is connected to a secure and stable Wi-Fi connection when updating to Android 12. Updating your device over a slow or unstable connection can cause the update to fail or take a long time to complete. Therefore, it is best to make sure your device is connected to a strong and secure connection before beginning the update.\nFinally, turn off automatic updates and ensure that your device has the latest version of Android 12 installed. This will ensure that your device is always up to date with the latest version and will prevent any potential issues that could arise from running an outdated version of Android.\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your Samsung device is safe and secure when updating from Android 11 to Android 12. Securely backup your data, factory reset your device, disable any third-party applications, secure a stable Wi-Fi connection, and disable automatic updates to maintain stability while updating.\n2. Preparation before the update Before the update, it is also important to free up some space on your device. You should delete unwanted apps, heavy files and media that you no longer need. Make sure there is minimum 8 GB empty space on your device, as this is enough for the update to install smoothly. If you need extra storage, you can transfer some of your videos, photos, or files to an external drive such as Google Drive, or simply delete them. Additionally, check your battery to make sure it is not too low when you update your device. If your battery is below 50%, it’s best to plug in your device and wait until it’s charged to at least 50%. Finally, make sure your Samsung device is connected to a good and stable Wi-Fi network prior to the update. A poor connection can cause your device to restart or freeze in the middle of the update process.\n3. How to Update with stability Create a backup of your existing data on your Android 11 device by going to settings. Install the Smart Switch app from the Google Play Store if it isn’t installed already. Update to Android 12 using the Smart Switch app which will ensure a stable transition for your data. Uninstall and disable superfluous applications to conserve RAM, as this will improve the stability of your device post update. Make sure to check that all of your previously installed apps are up to date on your freshly updated Android 12. Lastly, ensure that your device is kept up to date with regular security patches and OS updates to maintain stability and avoid possible security risks. 4. Post-update maintenance After backing up your data, ensure that the battery on your device is fully charged. This step is important to prevent your device from restarting or draining battery life during the update. When you know that the battery is fully charged, you can move on to the next step.\nIf you are using a Wi-Fi connection, you should also ensure that the connection is stable and fast enough to download the update. To do this, open the settings and look for the Wi-Fi network connection. If the connection is weak or slow, consider switching to a different Wi-Fi network.\nWhen you are ready to start the update, make sure you are connected to a secure, reliable source of power. Avoid using USB cables for charging as they can be unreliable in this situation. Consider using a wall outlet or power bank to charge your device.\nFinally, keep your device cool during the update. High temperatures and too much usage can cause your device to overheat and can cause the update to fail. To avoid overheating, consider using a fan or air cooler to keep your device cool.\nOnce the update is complete, you can use your device normally. After the update, it’s important to check your device for any potential problems. Make sure that all of your apps and settings are working properly and that there are no issues or errors.\nQ: What version of Android can I update my Samsung phone to? A: You can update your Samsung phone to Android 11 or Android 12, depending on the device and the availability of the update.\nQ: What is the best way to update Android on my Samsung device? A: The best way to update your Samsung device to Android 11 or Android 12 is through the official Samsung Smart Switch app. This app provides a seamless, secure and fast way to make sure your device is up to date with the latest Android version.\nQ: How can I maintain stability after I update my Samsung device? A: After updating your Samsung device to Android 11 or Android 12, you should back up all of your data and reset the device to its factory settings. This will help to maintain the stability of the updated system and reduce the chances of potential data loss or other issues.\nQ: What should I do if my Samsung device is not compatible with the latest version of Android? A: If your Samsung device is not compatible with the latest version of Android, you should check with your carrier to see if there are any other options available. If your device is still not compatible, you can either wait for a future update or switch to a newer device that is compatible with the latest version of Android.\nQ: Are there any risks to updating my Samsung device to Android 11 or Android 12? A: Generally, updating your Samsung device to Android 11 or Android 12 is a secure and safe process. However, there are always some risks involved, such as potential data loss, hardware compatibility issues, or even software bugs. To minimize these risks, it is important to make sure you have backed up all of your important data before updating your device.\n","wordCount":"1891","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terri Gilbert"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ericbrockk.github.io/posts/1980/how-to-maintain-stability-when-updating-from-android-11-to-12-on-samsung/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Eric Brockk","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ericbrockk.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Eric Brockk (Alt + H)"><img src=https://ericbrockk.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Eric Brockk</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Maintain Stability When Updating from Android 11 to 12 on Samsung</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 24, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1891 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Terri Gilbert</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-overview-of-android-11-and-12>1.
