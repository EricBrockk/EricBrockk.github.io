Don’t worry, here’s your step-by-step guide to help you transfer all your data from your Android device to your new iPhone using a USB cable. It is an exciting process to transition from Android to iPhone, but the key sticking point for many will be how to transfer their contacts, messages, photos and other data from the older device to a new one. There are various ways to do this, but here we will provide a step by step guide to help you transfer your Android data to iPhone using a USB cable, so you have all your data ready to go once you have completed the transition.\nAccording to a 2019 survey by the International Data Corporation (IDC), nearly 70 percent of smartphone users globally have Android devices. This highlights the importance of a successful Android to iPhone data transfer for users switching to Apple products.\nA reliable and secure way to perform an Android to iPhone data transfer is to use a USB cable connection, which can provide an efficient way to move data between devices. To successfully transfer data from an Android to an iPhone with a USB cable, users should follow these steps:\nFirst, connect the Android device to the computer using the appropriate USB cable. Once connected, users should locate the “My Computer” or “This PC” option on the computer and open it. Then, select the Android phone and open its folder. Next, locate the files or data they wish to transfer and copy them. Finally, disconnect the Android phone and connect the iPhone. Locate the iPhone in the same window, and paste the transferred files onto it. The data transfer is now complete.\nTransfer Data from Android Step 1: Activate the Developer Option on your Android Phone The first step is to get your Android device ready to start the transfer process. To do that, you need to activate the Developer Options on your Android phone. To activate the Developer Options, tap the “Settings” app on your Android phone and then go to “About Phone” and find the “Build Number.” Tap the “Build Number” 7 times and you will see a message that says, “Developer Options have been enabled.”\nStep 2: Connect your Android Phone and iPhone Connect your Android phone and your iPhone using the USB cable. Both your devices should be powered on and the USB cable should be connected to your laptop or power source.\nStep 3: Download and Install Files to your Android Device Download the “Android File Transfer” application from the Google Play Store onto your Android device. Install the app and open it. Your Android device should now be connected to your iPhone via the USB cable.\nStep 4: Transfer Files from Android to iPhone Once your Android device is connected to your iPhone, go to the “Android File Transfer” app and select the files you would like to transfer. You can select individual files or you can select multiple files for transfer. When you are finished selecting the files, press the “Send” button to transfer the files to your iPhone. Once the transfer is complete, you can disconnect the USB cable and your files should be transferred to your iPhone.\nI. Preparation for Transferring Data Plug in the USB cable to your Android phone, then connect it to your computer. Enable USB debugging in Developer Options, which you can access from the Android phone’s Settings App. Execute the Android File Transfer program on your computer and connect it to the Android phone via the USB cable. Select the target data you want to move from the Android phone. Select the “Copy” command and choose your desktop as the destination. Once all data are copied, connect your iPhone to the computer via a USB cable. Access the iTunes program on the computer and select your iPhone in the “Devices” menu. Once selected, click File and select “Devices” on the iTunes menu. Select “Transfer Purchases” and “Transfer from Android”. Confirm the data transfer and wait until it has been completed. II. Connect iPhone and Android Device Once Developer Options have been enabled, plug the USB cable into the Android device and connect it to your iPhone. Next, it is necessary to confirm that your Android device acts as a camera or a media device when connected to your iPhone. Tap the pop-up window that appears and select the appropriate option. Once complete, the devices will be properly connected and the data transfer will be possible. To begin the transfer process, open the Settings app on the iOS device and select the “Transfer Data from Android” option. After following the prompts, the two phones will be connected and the transfer process will begin automatically.\nIII. Transfer Data from Android to iPhone After activating Developer Options, go to the Developer Options menu and turn the USB debugging ‘ON’. Now connect your Android phone to the computer using USB cable. Open the interface for Android File Transfer on your computer. On the window that appears, you can now drag and drop the files you want to transfer from the Android phone to the computer. Disconnect the USB cable. Now connect the iPhone to the computer with the USB cable. Open the iTunes interface on your computer and select the iPhone. On the interface, click the ‘File Sharing’ button, select the app you want to share files with and then drag-and-drop the files from your computer to the iPhone. Disconnect your iPhone from the computer after the files have been transferred. IV. Disconnect and Complete the Process Once Developer Options has been enabled, open it in your Settings app and enable USB Debugging. This will allow the USB connection between Android and iPhone. Then connect the USB cable between the devices. Your Android will prompt you to install a specific driver, choose to install the driver on the Android device. You will then be prompted on your iPhone to Trust This Computer, click Trust and enter the passcode to confirm the action. Once the devices are connected, the transfer process should automatically begin. After the process is done, disconnect the USB cable between the devices and the transfer process is complete.\nQ1: What is Android to iPhone Data Transfer?
