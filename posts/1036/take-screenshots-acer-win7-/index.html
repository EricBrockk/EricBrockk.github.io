On an Acer laptop running Windows 7, taking screenshots is very simple. All that’s needed is to press the Print Screen (PrtScr) keys to capture the whole screen, or hold Alt+PrtScr to capture a particular window. When pressing the PrtScr button, the screenshot is automatically saved in the computer’s clipboard, so they can be pasted into image editing software for further editing. After taking a screenshot with PrtScr, users can press Windows+PrtScr to save the screenshot automatically as an image. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for taking screenshots on an Acer laptop running Windows 7.\n2. How to Take Screenshots on an Acer Laptop Running Windows 7 Taking screenshots on an Acer laptop running Windows 7 is easy. To capture the whole screen, press the Print Screen (PrtScr) keys. If you are looking to only take a screenshot of a particular window, hold down the Alt key and then press the PrtScr key. After you press the Print Screen key, the screenshot will be copied to your clipboard and can be pasted into any image editing or word processing software.\nIf you want to save the screenshot as an image file without pasting it in any other program, you can use the Snipping Tool. This tool is part of Windows 7 and can be found in the Start Menu. With the Snipping Tool you can take a screenshot of the entire screen or just part of it. And it allows you to save the screenshot in different image formats.\nIf you have a device with a touch-screen, such as the Acer Iconia Tab W500, you can use the Windows 7 Snipping Tool to take screenshots. Simply open the Snipping Tool, press the New button, select the area of the screen you want to capture, and then release the mouse button. The screenshot will be saved to a file.\nLastly, if you have an Acer laptop with an Synaptics touchpad, you can use the dedicated screenshot button located near the top left corner of the touchpad. You just need to press and hold the button for a period of time (about 1 second) and the screenshot will be saved to a file.\nTaking screenshots on an Acer laptop running Windows 7 is simple and easy. With the Print Screen key, the Snipping Tool and the dedicated screenshot button, you can capture anything you need with just a few clicks.\na. Using the Print Screen Button Once you hit the Print Screen (PrtScr) button the screenshot will be stored in your laptop’s Clipboard. To access and view the screenshot open a photo editor such as Paint by going to Programs -\u003e Accessories -\u003e Paint. This will open a blank page in the Paint program with an option to paste the photo from the Clipboard. Select the paste option to paste the screenshot onto the Paint program.\nYou can also use the Alt+PrtScr command to capture a particular window instead of the whole screen. To do this, hit Alt+PrtScr keys together at the same time and the screenshot of the active window will be stored in the Clipboard. Follow the same instructions as described above to paste the screenshot on the Paint program.\nIf you wish to save the screenshot, click on the File menu located on the top left and select Save. When the pop-up window appears, choose a name and directory for the file and select the format the file should be saved in, such as JPEG or Bitmap. Once everything is selected, click Save and the screenshot will be saved into the directory you chose.\nAlternatively, you can also capture screenshots of a single window or an area of the screen by using the Snipping Tool built-in within the Windows 7 operating system. To access this tool, simply search for Snipping Tool in the Start Menu search bar. After selecting the area that you want to capture, the screenshot will appear in a new window and can be saved in a similar way to the above method. You can also edit the screenshot before saving it by using the Snipping Tool.\nAdditionally, you can also take a screenshot of the entire Web page, even if it is longer than the height of the screen. To do this, simply use the “Snipping Tool” described above and select “Scroll window” before taking a screenshot. This will allow you to capture the screenshot of the entire Web page and save it in the same manner as described above.\nFinally, if you want to use the screenshots for other purposes such as for printing or sending as an email attachment, you can also use the Windows 7 built-in “Snipping Tool” and select the “Custom” option. This will allow you to select the exact area of the screenshot you want to capture, including any parts of the Web page that may not appear on the screen. You can then save or print the custom screenshot the same way as described above.\nb. Using Third-party Screenshot Software Using Third-party Screenshot Software can also be a viable option for taking screenshots. Many third-party screenshot programs are available for free, such as the Snipping Tool.

To take a screenshot with third-party software:\nGo to the Start Menu and search for Snipping Tool Open the Snipping Tool and select the desired shape of the screenshot. Holding the mouse, drag it across the area you want to capture and then click on the save button. Select the format and folder you would like to save the file.

This software is more comprehensive and allows you to take screenshot of the entire screen, a particular window, a certain region of the screen, a free-hand selection, and even a web page. To use PicPick:\nGo to the download page and install the software. Once installed, open the PicPick from the desktop or the Start Menu. You will be taken to the main interface.
