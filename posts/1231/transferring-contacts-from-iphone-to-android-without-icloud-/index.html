Well, there are several ways to easily transfer contacts from iPhone to Android without having to rely on iCloud.\nUsing a SIM card A SIM card or Subscriber Identity Module, is the best way to transfer contacts from an iOS device to an Android device. On an iPhone, the contacts are usually stored on the SIM card and not within the device itself.\nTo begin, you will need to take out the SIM card from you iPhone and insert it in you Android device. Then follow the steps below:\nOn your Android device, open the Contacts app. Tap the menu icon in the upper right corner and select “Import/Export”. Select the option to “Import from SIM card”. You can choose to import all contacts or just selected contacts. Once the process is complete, your contacts from the iPhone will be available in the Contacts app on your Android device.\nUsing an Email App If you don’t want to use a SIM card, you can also use an email app to transfer your contacts from your iPhone to your Android device.\nOn you iPhone, open the Contacts app. Select all the contacts you want to transfer and tap “Share Contact”. Select “Mail”. In the “To” field, put in the email address associated with your Android device. Tap “Send”.

After the contacts have been imported, they may need to be manually adjusted to fit the Android’s operating system. Lastly, the imported contacts can be accessed in the contacts list of the Android device.\n3. Exporting contacts from iPhone Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards are a great way to transfer contacts from your iPhone to Android without the help of iCloud. To do this effectively, you’ll need two SIM cards. The first is the iPhone’s existing SIM card, while the second is a blank SIM card that needs to be inserted into the Android.

To activate the contacts on the iPhone, simply open the contacts list and select the import contacts option. This will bring up a list of contacts stored on the iPhone’s SIM card, which can then be added to the iPhone’s contact list. With this process complete, you can now easily move contacts from iPhone to Android without the help of iCloud.\n4.
