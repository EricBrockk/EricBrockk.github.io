A message will be displayed on the screen confirming that your phone number has been unregistered from the voicemail service.\nFollowing these 5 simple steps, you can easily and quickly turn off the voicemail on your Android device. According to Jim Jensen, a certified mobile phone technician, “It’s important to keep your phone’s voicemail feature turned ‘OFF’ to avoid any unnecessary charges or problems with your network provider.”\nStep by Step Guide on Turning Off Voicemail on Android\nHow to Disable Voicemail on Your Android Phone\nStrategies to Stop Receiving Unwanted Voicemails on Android\nDisable Voicemail on Android Start by unlocking your Android device and tap on the phone icon. Dial the code to access your voicemail. This can be either “*86” followed by the “Send” button or “#004#” followed by “Send”. Wait for the automated voice to finish speaking. Press the “#” key once the voice has finished speaking. The automated voice should now confirm that the voicemail has been deactivated and you should be able to hear a tone to confirm this. 1. Identify What Voicemail Is and What It Does Voicemail is a service that allows you to record a voice message in order to have it played back to the caller instead of an unanswered ringing. It can also be used as a way of storing messages from contacts or sending pre-recorded messages to contacts. To turn off voicemail on Android, follow these simple steps: unlock your Android device, tap the phone icon, dial the code (*86 or #004# + Send); wait for the automated voice to come on; press the # key when you’re done speaking; and the automated voice will confirm voicemail deactivation. After deactivation, all incoming calls will go directly to voicemail, and any saved voicemails will be erased. You may also be required to enter a voicemail PIN to gain access to the voice mail system. Lastly, you can turn on voicemail again by dialing a code, such as *86 or *21, and waiting for the automated voice to come on. Be sure to follow the instructions for deactivating and activating voicemail correctly to ensure that you don’t accidentally lock yourself out of your voicemail system.\n2. Access Voicemail Settings on Your Android Start by unlocking your Android device. Tap the phone icon to launch your phone dialer. Enter the code for turning off voicemail, either *86 or #004#, then press the Send button. This code may be different depending on your Android carrier service. Wait for the automated voice message and follow the prompts. When you’re done speaking, press the # key. The automated voice should confirm that voicemail has been deactivated. 3. Disable Voicemail Notification Third, disable the voicemail notification tone. This can be done by going to the settings menu of the device and selecting the Sounds and Notifications option. Here, you will be able to customize your sound and notifications preferences, including turning off any incoming voicemail notifications. Once the desired changes are made to the settings, the voicemail notification sound will no longer be heard when a new Voicemail is received. It is important to note that disabling the notification tone will not disable the voicemail feature itself, merely the notifications informing the user of the voicemail. The user will still be able to dial the voicemail system and access voicemails from the menu.\n4. Deactivate Voicemail Service Fourth, deactivate the voicemail service. This process requires dialing a special code using the device’s keypad. Android users should dial either *86 or #004# and then press the Send button. After doing this, they should wait for an automated voice to activate. Once it is activated, they need to press the pound key and the automated voice will confirm that the voicemail service has been successfully deactivated. Lastly, users should end the call and confirm that the change has been made.\n5. Check Voicemail Deactivation Status Check Voicemail Deactivation Status. Once the codes have been entered, the voicemail deactivation process is complete. To ensure the voicemail has been completely deactivated, users should try dialing the voicemail number to verify it is no longer active. If the line is busy for more than a few seconds, it is likely that the voicemail is still turned on. It is also possible to contact the provider to confirm the voicemail has been deactivated. Be sure to also check the voicemail settings on the phone to make sure the icon is no longer present and the voicemail tab has been removed from the settings. Q1.
