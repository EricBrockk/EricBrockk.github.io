Then update the version of the conflicting library or the Gradle plugin version to resolve the conflict.\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot the most common Gradle plugin version issues in Android Studio projects.\n1. Introduction to Gradle Plugin Version Issues Gradle is an automated build system used in Android Studio projects. It manages all the dependencies required for the project to compile and run successfully. However, the incompatibility between different Gradle plugin versions used in the build process can cause Gradle plugin version issues. These can be solved by following a few simple steps.\nFirst, check the Gradle version of the project in build.gradle file. Make sure that the version used is compatible with the Android Studio version and your build tools. It’s important to note that the latest Gradle version works best with the latest Android Studio version.\nSecond, check the dependencies listed in the build.gradle file. All of the dependencies must be compatible with the project’s Gradle version. If you need to add a dependency not compatible with the existing version, you should update the project’s Gradle version to the latest version available.\nThird, you can use the newer Gradle plugin version by editing the gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties file. In this file, you can change the distributionUrl property and set the new Gradle version of your choice.\nFourth, don’t forget to sync the project with the new Gradle version after making changes. To do this, go to the Build menu and click on the Rebuild Project. You can also use the Sync Now option in the File menu.\nFinally, if you need to include external binaries such as JAR or AAR files, you should use the Gradle build system. To do this, add the external files as dependencies in the build.gradle file. Then, you just need to rebuild the project. That’s it!\nBy following these steps, you can easily troubleshoot Gradle plugin version issues in an Android Studio project. This helps ensure that the project runs properly and all the external dependencies are included.\n2. Reasons for Occurrence of Gradle Plugin Version Issues Gradle plugin version issues can occur due to a variety of reasons. It can be caused by incompatibilities between the different Gradle versions used in the build process, different JDK versions, or incorrectly configured Gradle. It is also important to consider Gradle settings that might not be compatible with the version of Gradle plugin used. Sometimes an issue can be the result of old out-of-date dependency versions, insufficient Gradle cache memory settings, or a corrupted local Gradle repository. Additionally, the cause can be poorly written Gradle scripts or incorrectly configured external binaries such as JAR or AAR files. Regardless of the reason, the quickest way to troubleshoot Gradle plugin version issues in an Android Studio project is to clear the project’s Gradle cache and restart Android Studio. Another helpful troubleshooting step is to ensure that the proper versions of the Gradle plugin, Gradle version, and JDK are used.
