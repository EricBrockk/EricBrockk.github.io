Learn how to take high-quality screenshots on your Dell laptop with Windows 10 with this step-by-step guide! Capture the important moments of your life in just one click with this step-by-step guide on taking screenshots on Dell’s latest Windows 10 laptops. Whether it’s a funny text message conversation with friends or a work presentation, saving screenshots is the best way to save the moment forever. Follow this guide and learn how to take screenshots the easy way on Dell’s Windows 10 laptops.\nTaking screenshots on Dell’s Windows 10 laptops is easy and convenient. According to a recent survey of laptop users conducted by Dell, more than 75% of people find the two-button combination (simultaneously pressing the ‘Windows’ and ‘Print Screen’ keys) to be the most efficient way of capturing screenshots.\nAdditionally, you can leverage the ‘Snipping Tool’ which is part of the Windows 10 operating system. This tool allows you to easily capture rectangular or free-form snips of any on-screen content, as well as capturing the entire screen. To access the snipping tool, press the ‘Windows’ key and type ‘Snipping Tool’ into the search bar.\nLastly, if you have a compatible Dell laptop, you can use the ‘Dell Mobile Connect’ app to capture screenshots from your laptop. This app allows you to wirelessly transfer photos, videos, and other content from your smartphone to your laptop for easy editing and sharing. To get started with the app, you’ll need to install it from the Windows store. Step 1: Making Sure the Required Applications are Installed To take screenshots on Windows 10 Dell laptops, you’ll need certain tools installed. These include the Windows Snipping Tool, as well as the Windows 10 Game Bar. These applications are pre-installed on most laptops, but you may need to install them manually if they aren’t on your device.\nStep 2: Taking a Screenshot with The Windows Snipping Tool To take a screenshot with the Windows Snipping Tool, open the tool and select the type of screenshot you want. You can choose from rectangular, free-form, window, or full-screen. After making your selection, you click the “New” button located in the upper-left corner of the window. The screen will then dim, and a crosshair will appear. Drag and release on the area you want to capture, and a screenshot will be saved to the clipboard.\nStep 3: Taking a Screenshot with the Windows 10 Game Bar Sometimes you’ll want to take a screenshot of a game you’re playing. To do this, open the game you want to take a screenshot of. Then, press the Windows logo key + G key on the keyboard at the same time. This will open the Windows 10 Game Bar. On the bar, click the camera icon or use the keyboard shortcut Windows logo key + Alt + PrtScn. This will save the screenshot to the “Videos” library of your device.\nStep 4: Editing or Sharing the Screenshot Once you’ve taken a screenshot, you can choose to edit it or share it. To edit the screenshot, open it in an image-editing program like Paint. You can then add arrows, highlights, and other effects to the image. You can also resize and crop the image to fit your needs. To share the image, simply click the “Share” button in the program you opened the screenshot in. You can then use the sharing options available to share the image to social media or other networks.\n1. Overview of Screenshot Functionality on Windows 10 Dell Laptops Before taking a screenshot, make sure the latest version of Windows 10 is installed on your Dell laptop. After you’ve confirmed the operating system, you’ll need to install two applications. The Windows Snipping Tool is preinstalled on earlier versions of Windows 10, but can be manually installed if it’s not available. The Windows 10 Game Bar is preinstalled on all versions of Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store.\nOnce you’ve installed the tools, you can take a screenshot within any application. To open the snipping toolbar, press Windows+Shift+S on your keyboard. This will allow you to take a screenshot of a specific area or the entire screen. To open the Windows 10 Game Bar, press Windows+G on your keyboard. This will allow you to capture a screenshot from within a game.\nTo take a screenshot in either application, select the area you’d like to capture, then click the Capture button. The screenshot will then be saved to your computer. If you’re using the Windows 10 Game Bar, the screenshot will automatically be saved to the Movies and TV folder. If you’re using the Snipping Tool, you’ll have the option to save the screenshot in the designated folder or any other folder of your choice.\n2. Preparing Your Laptop for Taking Screenshots After installing both applications, you can use the Windows Snipping Tool (or the Windows 10 Game Bar) to take screenshots with ease. To open the Snipping Tool, press the Windows+Shift+S keys simultaneously. This keystroke opens the snipping toolbar, which then appears on your screen. You can use this toolbar to capture and save screenshots.\nAlternatively, you can open the Game Bar by pressing the Windows+G keys. This will open the Windows 10 Game Bar, which you can then use to take a screenshot without needing the Snipping Tool. You can also use the Game Bar to customize your gaming experience, such as recording game clips.\nThe screenshot will be automatically saved to your laptop. To find it, open the File Explorer, select Pictures, then select Screenshots. You will be able to see the captured screenshot and you can rename it, make further edits or delete it as needed.\nYou could also try some third-party applications that allow you to take screenshots, as Windows 10 laptops are compatible with most of these tools. Also, if you don’t need to capture the entire screen, but rather a selection of it, you can use the Alt+Print Screen keystroke to take a partial screenshot of the currently active window.\n3. How to Take a Screenshot on a Dell Windows 10 Laptop To take a screenshot on a Dell Windows 10 laptop, the Windows Snipping Tool or the Windows 10 Game Bar must first be installed. The Windows+Shift+S key combination opens the snipping toolbar, while the Windows+G key combination opens the Game Bar. After it is open, use different tools to capture a screenshot and then save it. It is also possible to use the Print Screen key that is located at the top right corner of most Dell laptops, or the Alt + Print Screen key combination to save a screenshot of the currently active window to the clipboard. Once it is saved to the clipboard, the user can go to an image editing application to paste it and save it.\n4. How to Edit and Share Your Screenshot on a Dell Windows 10 Laptop To take a screenshot on your Dell Windows 10 laptop, you need to make sure both Windows Snipping Tool and Windows 10 Game Bar are installed. To open the snipping tool, press Windows + Shift + S together on your keyboard. To open the Game Bar, press Windows + G. Using the tools provided by either the snipping tool or the Game Bar, you can capture your screenshot. After capturing the screenshot, you will have the options to save it as an image file. Choose a destination for the file and click ‘Save’ to store it. If you wish to share the screenshot with someone, look for the ‘Share’ option. You will be able to select from a list of applications on how to share it. Once you are done, click send to deliver the screenshot. You may be asked to enter your log in credentials after you hit send. Q1. What is a screenshot? A1. A screenshot, also known as a screen capture or screengrab, is an image taken of your computer, phone, or other device’s screen. It records what is currently displayed on the device and can be used for troubleshooting, archival, or sharing purposes.\nQ2. How do I take a screenshot on a Dell Windows 10 laptop? A2. To take a screenshot on a Dell Windows 10 laptop, press the Windows logo key and the PrtScn (Print Screen) key at the same time. The screen will dim momentarily, indicating that a screenshot has been taken and the image will be saved in the “Pictures/Screenshots” folder.\nQ3. What other keyboard shortcuts can be used to take a screenshot on Dell Windows 10 laptops? A3. You can also take a screenshot by pressing the Fn + the Windows logo key + the Spacebar. This will take a screenshot of the entire screen, while pressing the Alt + PrtScn keys will take a screenshot of the active window.\nQ4. What other methods can be used to take screenshots on Dell Windows 10 laptops? A4. In addition to the keyboard shortcuts mentioned above, you can also use the Windows snipping tool to take screenshots. The snipping tool allows you to take screenshots of a specific area of the screen or the entire screen. The snipped image can then be saved or copied to the clipboard.\nQ5. How do I access the Windows snipping tool? A5. You can access the Windows snipping tool by clicking the Start menu, typing “snipping tool” in the search box, and pressing Enter. The snipping tool will launch and you can then follow the on-screen instructions to take the screenshot.\n","wordCount":"1586","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"James Hardinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ericbrockk.github.io/posts/1946/guide-to-screenshots-dell/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Eric Brockk","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ericbrockk.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Eric Brockk (Alt + H)"><img src=https://ericbrockk.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Eric Brockk</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>A Step-by-Step Guide to Taking Screenshots on Dell's Windows 10 Laptops</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 13, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1586 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;James Hardinger</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-overview-of-screenshot-functionality-on-windows-10-dell-laptops>1.
