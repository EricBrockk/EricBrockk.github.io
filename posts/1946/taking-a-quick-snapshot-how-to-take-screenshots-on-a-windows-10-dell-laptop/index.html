Preparation: Understanding What You Need Before taking the screenshot, make sure you understand what you need to do. First, know where the ‘Print Screen’ button is, usually located above the Insert button on your keyboard. Once you have located it, make sure you have a photo editing software installed on your laptop. This can be as simple as Microsoft Paint or Microsoft Word, or as advanced as Adobe Photoshop. Having this program will allow you to paste the screenshot onto the software and save it as an image.\n2. Different Methods of Taking a Screenshot One of the most convenient methods of taking a screenshot on a Windows 10 Dell laptop is to simply press the ‘Print Screen’ button on the keyboard. This action captures the whole screen and saves the image to the clipboard. This means that the image can be easily pasted into any image editing software such as Paint 3D. Furthermore, this screenshot can also be used as a wallpaper or shared with friends in an email, text, or online post.\nAside from pressing the ‘Print Screen’ button, there is also an alternative way to take a screenshot on the Windows 10 Dell laptop. This method requires the user to press the combination of ‘Alt + PrtScn’ keys. This action saves the image of the active window to the clipboard. After which, the image can be edited with any editing software.\nThe ‘Windows Key + PrtScn’ key combination is also an alternative way to take a screenshot on the Windows 10 Dell laptop. This action saves the image of the entire screen to the ‘Pictures’ folder in the laptop’s file directory. This feature can be very convenient as it saves the user from the hassle of pasting the screenshot onto an image editing software.\nIn addition to taking a screenshot of the whole screen, the ‘Windows Key + Shift + S’ key combination is available to take a partial screenshot. This action opens the ‘Snipping Tool’ window which allows the user to select any region of the screen to capture. The captured screenshot is then saved to the clipboard which can be pasted into any image editing software.\nLastly, the ‘Windows Key + Volume Down’ key combination is also an alternative method of taking a screenshot on the Windows 10 Dell laptop. This combination saves the image of the entire screen to the ‘Screenshots’ folder in the laptop’s file directory. This action is especially useful if the user needs to take a quick screenshot of the entire screen.\n3. Saving and Locating Your Screenshot When you press the ‘Print Screen’ button, the screenshot is automatically copied to the clipboard. To paste the screenshot to an image editing software, go to the editing software and select ‘Paste’ or ‘Ctrl+V’ from the menu. The screenshot should then paste onto the image editing software, where you can edit and save it. You can also select ‘Save As’ from the menu to save the screenshot directly onto your laptop. You will be asked to assign a file name and file type before the screenshot is saved.\nIt is important to remember that the screenshot is saved to a temporary folder on your laptop. To ensure that your screenshot is saved to the right place, you can go to ‘File’ and select ‘Open’. You can then specify where the picture is saved in the ‘Select Folder’ window. This will allow you to easily locate and edit the screenshot.\nAlternatively, if you have a Windows 10 laptop, you can also access and view the screenshots taken using the ‘Windows Game Bar’. You can access this bar by pressing ‘Windows + G’ on your keyboard. This will open the ‘Windows Game Bar’ where you can select the ‘Camera’ icon. This will open up a window that lets you view all the screenshots taken using the ‘Print Screen’ button.\n4.

After that, the screenshot will be ready to be pasted onto any image editing software.\nAnother way of taking a screenshot is by using a built-in snipping tool. To access it, press the Windows key and type ‘Snipping Tool’. Then select the desired area and press the ‘Ctrl’ and ‘Print Screen’ buttons together. This way you can take a screenshot of the desired area without including the unnecessary details.\nIf you want to capture a scrolling window, the snipping tool can be used for that as well. To do so, press the ‘New’ button and then select the ‘Scroll’ option. Then scroll down to the desired page or portion and release the mouse. This will create a screenshot of the scrolling window.\nFinally, if you want to record a short video clip, the Snipping Tool can be useful for that as well.
