Overview of transferring contacts from iPhone 5 to Android Phone After you launch the Move to iOS app on your Android device and agree to the terms and conditions, you will be prompted to create a secure connection between your Android device and the iPhone 5. To create the connection, you will need to enter a code on your Android device that will be displayed on your iPhone 5. Make sure to provide the same Apple ID and Password that is associated with the iPhone 5.\nOnce the connection has been established, the Move to iOS app will begin transferring your contacts from the iPhone 5 over to your Android device. During this process, the app will recognize all of your contacts separately, so you are able to select which ones you want to transfer. Additionally, Move to iOS app will also transfer any additional data such as photos, videos, and music.\nIn addition to using the Move to iOS app, you can also transfer your contacts manually.

Different phones have different capabilities and you should be sure that there is a compatible method for the transfer.

Enter your Google account information to link the phones. Once they are connected, open up the Contacts app and sync them, so your contacts are transferred to your Android phone. The other option is to install the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store. Open Settings on your iPhone and tap the “Move Data from Android” option. Follow the on-screen instructions and enter the one-time code provided by the app. The contacts will be transferred to your Android phone in a few minutes.

Additionally, make sure that all the contacts you transferred are in the correct format.\nFinally, if you need to transfer more content from your iPhone 5 to your Android phone, you can always do it again by repeating the same steps.
