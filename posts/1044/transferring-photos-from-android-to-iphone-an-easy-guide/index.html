AirDrop allows users to quickly and securely share photos between two iPhones, or between an Android and an iPhone. “This is a great way to quickly move photos from one device to the other without having to rely on a third-party app or plugging the devices into a computer,” he says.\nAccording to recent statistics, more than 80 percent of smartphone users rely on their devices to access photos and videos. With the prevalence of mobile devices, transferring photos between an Android and an iPhone quickly and securely has become a priority for many users. Fortunately, Apple’s AirDrop feature makes it possible for users to transfer photos between devices with a few simple steps.\nTransferring photos from an Android to an iPhone is incredibly easy. All users need to do is open the AirDrop menu on their iPhone and select the device from which they want to send the photos. Once the device is selected, the user can select the photos they want to transfer. Once the photos have been selected, the user can click “Send” and the photos will be transferred in a matter of seconds. For additional security, users can also choose to encrypt the photo transfer with a password.\nA Quick Tutorial on Transfering Photos using Bluetooth between Android and iPhone How to Use Bluetooth to Transfer Pictures from Android to iPhone Transfer Photos with Bluetooth A Step by Step Guide to Transfer Photos from Android to iPhone Are you switching from Android to iPhone?
