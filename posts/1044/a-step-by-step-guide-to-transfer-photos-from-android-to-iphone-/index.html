Get the fast track on transferring all those precious memories in one easy, step-by-step process! Are you a proud new owner of an iPhone, but don’t know how to transfer your photos from your old Android device to your new iPhone? Don’t worry, it’s easier than you think. In this step-by-step guide, we’ll show you how to move all of your photos from one device to the other, without needing any cables or having to use iCloud. So ready your device, let’s go!\nTransferring photos from Android to iPhone is now easier than ever thanks to the wide variety of mobile cloud services available. According to a survey conducted by Statista, 40.8 percent of users rely on cloud-based services like Google Drive and Dropbox to move photos from one platform to another.\nWith cloud services, you can easily upload your photos from your Android device to the cloud, and then access them from your iPhone. The process is relatively simple and straightforward. First, open a cloud storage app on your Android device. Then select the photos you want to upload and hit “upload.” Finally, log into your cloud storage account using your iPhone and download the photos.\nIt is important to note that transferring photos from an Android device to an iPhone may require the use of third party apps. For example, AirDrop is an app that allows users to wirelessly transfer photos and other files between iOS and Android devices. While AirDrop is a great way to move photos between devices quickly, it is important to remember to delete the photos from the receiver’s device after they have been transferred.\nHow to Use Bluetooth to Transfer Pictures from Android to iPhone Transfer Photos with Bluetooth Step 1: Install Google Photos on your Android phone and iPhone. Open Google Play Store on your Android phone and look for the Google Photos app. Download and install it. Then, open the App Store on your iPhone, search for Google Photos, and install it.\nStep 2: Back up your photos on your Android phone. Open the Google Photos app on your Android and tap the three-bar icon in the top left corner. Select Settings and then tap on ‘Back up \u0026 sync.’ Make sure this is turned on.\nStep 3: Transfer photos to your iPhone. Open Google Photos on your iPhone and sign in with your Google account. Tap on the three-bar icon, select Device Folders and then choose the device you want to transfer your photos from. It should detect your Android phone. Choose the photos you would like to transfer and tap the arrow in the top right corner. Your photos should now appear in your Google Photos library on your iPhone.\nStep 4: Select and download photos on your iPhone. In your Google Photos library, select the photos you would like to download to your iPhone. Tap the three dots in the top right corner and choose ‘Download.’ Your photos will now be downloaded and stored in your iPhone’s Photos app.\nStep 5: Share your photos with friends and family. Go back to the Google Photos app on your iPhone. Select the photos you want to share and tap the share icon in the top right corner. Then, choose which method you want to share the photos with, such as email or WhatsApp.\n1. Introduction of Different Phone Systems Google Photos app has two ways to transfer photos from one device to another. The first way is using a direct transfer, which requires both devices to be connected to the same internet connection. The second method is using the cloud-to-cloud transfer, which doesn’t require any cables or internet connections, but instead transferring the photos directly from one cloud system to another. Once your photos have been transferred from one device to another, they will be stored in the Google Photos app on each device. This allows you to have all of your photos backed up in one place across multiple devices.\n2. Preparing for the Transfer Once Google Photos is installed and loaded up on both your devices, log in to your Google account on both your Android and iPhone. Make sure the same Google account is used as this will sync the devices so the photos will be transferred from your Android to iPhone.\nThe next step is to open up Google Photos on your Android device, tap the three-bar icon located in the top left-hand corner and select Settings. Then, tap the option labelled ‘Back up \u0026 sync’. Make sure the toggle is switched on. Now, you should see the message ‘Your device is backed up’.\nFor the next step, open up Google Photos on the iPhone device. Select the three-bar icon and select the Settings option. Make sure both settings, Backup \u0026 Sync and Google Photos are enabled. When this is done, the photos on your Android device will be transferred to your iPhone.\nTo ensure the photos have transferred correctly, open up your iPhone’s Google Photos app and select the ‘Photos’ tab. If the photos have transferred correctly, they will appear in the app. To transfer the photos manually, select the three-dot icon and select any photo you wish to transfer. Then select the ‘Back up now’ option.\nIf your photos aren’t transferring automatically, you can still manually select which ones you wish to migrate using the Backup \u0026 Sync tool. Simply turn off the Auto-Backup option, select the photos you wish to transfer, and select the Backup Now option. This will transfer the chosen photos from your Android to your iPhone.\nNow, if you wish to make sure that all photos from your Android device have been transferred to your iPhone, select the three-bar icon on your Android and select the ‘Device Folders’ tab. Tap the folder icon labeled ‘Photos on device’, then select the three-dot icon and choose the option labelled ‘Transfer to device’. You will then be able to select the iPhone device from the list of available devices and once connected, the photos will be transferred.\n3. Transferring Photos from Android to iPhone Transferring Photos from Android to iPhone. The next step is to link both the Android and iPhone to your Google Photos. Begin by downloading and installing Google Photos on both your Android and iPhone. Then, open the Google Photos app on your Android and tap the three-bar icon to back up your photos. The photos will be backed up to your Google Photos account if the user has chosen to do so. Once the photos are backed up to your Google Photos account, open up the Google Photos app on your iPhone and sign in with the same credentials used on your Android device. Next, tap the square icon in the bottom left corner of the Google Photos app, which will open up the settings page. On this page, toggle the Free up space button to on and the photos will automatically be removed from your Android device. Finally, all of the photos that were backed up to your Google Photos account will appear on your iPhone. To access them, simply open up the Google Photos app on your iPhone and voila! All of your photos are now accessible on your iPhone. 4. Finishing Touches Once you have installed and opened Google Photos, you can begin the transfer process. Start by tapping the three-bar icon at the top left and select “Device Folders”. This will show all the albums and folders stored on your Android device. Select the ones you would like to transfer over to your iPhone by tapping the check mark next to them. Make sure that you are also selecting any photos that might be stored in the main Google Photos folder.\nNext, tap the “Send” button at the bottom right. After a few seconds, a window will appear with your device’s name and storage information. Tap the “Send” button again to confirm the transfer.\nAfter the transfer is complete, switch to the Google Photos app on your iPhone. Tap the “Receive” button at the bottom right. This will open a window with your Android phone’s name and storage information. Tap “Receive” again to download the photos to your iPhone.\nIf you are transferring a large number of photos, it might take a few minutes for the transfer to complete. You can check on the status of the transfer by looking at the progress bar at the bottom of the screen. Once the transfer is complete, you can view your photos in the Google Photos app.\nFinally, go back to your Android device and delete the photos that you transferred.

This means that you won’t have to worry about the photos being lost or damaged during the transfer process. Additionally, cloud storage services are generally fast and easy to use, and don’t require a physical connection between the two devices.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://ericbrockk.github.io/posts/1603/a-comprehensive-guide-on-how-to-upgrade-android-version-in-redmi-4-/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>A Comprehensive Guide on How to Upgrade Android Version in Redmi 4</span></a>
