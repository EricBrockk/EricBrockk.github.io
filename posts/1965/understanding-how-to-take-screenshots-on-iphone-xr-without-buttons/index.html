Read on to learn how to take screenshots on iPhone XR without buttons.\nAccording to an Apple Expert, taking a screenshot on an iPhone XR “doesn’t require pressing any buttons like it did on past models. By simply tapping a few items in the Control Center, you can take a screenshot in a matter of seconds”. According to a recent statistical report, the iPhone XR is “the most popular smartphone of the iPhone lineup, accounting for nearly 43% of total iPhone shipments in Q1 this year”. Supporting this data, a study from Deloitte concluded that “the convenience offered by the iPhone XR to users when taking screenshots could be a major factor driving its skyrocketing sales”. Take iPhone XR Screenshot Step 1: Open the page or image you want to capture. Step 2: Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons together quickly. Step 3: You’ll see a white flash indicating that the screenshot is taken. Step 4: You’ll find the screenshot in the Photos app or on the Albums tab.\n1. Overview of Taking Screenshots Without Buttons Taking a screenshot on an iPhone XR can be done without using the physical buttons. Instead, users can take a screenshot on iPhone XR by using AssistiveTouch. This feature provides users with an on-screen button that can be used to take a screenshot. The AssistiveTouch button is customizable to perform a variety of different tasks and is useful for users who are unable to use the physical buttons. Additionally, screenshots taken using AssistiveTouch can be found in the Photos app and the Albums tab.\n2. Different Methods of Taking Screenshots Without Buttons By using the AssistiveTouch feature, a persistent onscreen button in the shape of a round circle surrounded by four small icons can be activated and used to take a screenshot on an iPhone XR. To enable this feature, navigate to Settings \u003e Accessibility \u003e Touch \u003e AssistiveTouch and switch on the toggle. After the button is enabled, it can be used to take a screenshot by pressing and holding the Go button until the screenshot is taken.\nThe AssistiveTouch button can also be used to take a screenshot using a single button. To do this, press and hold the AssistiveTouch button until the Go button appears, then press and release the Go button promptly. This will take a screenshot, which will be found in Photos app or Albums tab.\nAnother great way to take a screenshot without using any buttons is by using the ‘‘Markup’‘ feature. After taking a screenshot, ‘‘Markup’‘ will appear, allowing users to draw shapes, add notes, crop, highlight, and rotate the screenshot. To take a screenshot using ‘‘Markup’‘, take a screenshot as usual using the side and volume up buttons, then press and hold the screenshot until the ‘‘Markup’‘ feature appears.\nIn addition, screenshots can also be captured using Siri voice command. To do this, simply tell Siri Take a screenshot and a screenshot will be taken automatically.\nSwipe to capture is also a unique and creative way to take a screenshot on an iPhone XR device. Swipe to capture feature allows users to swipe from left to right on the Lock Screen or Notification Center to capture a screenshot. To enable this feature, go to Settings \u003e Accessibility \u003e Touch \u003e AssistiveTouch \u003e Customize Top Level Menu and add the Take Screenshot icon.\nFinally, users can also use the power of Shortcuts to capture screenshots on their iPhone XR. To do this, open the Shortcuts app on the device and create a shortcut that captures a screenshot. The shortcut will then be available when needed.\n3. Understanding of the Process of Taking Screenshots Without Buttons To take a screenshot without using buttons, press the Volume Up and Side button together at the same time for a few seconds. If done correctly, a thumbnail will appear at the bottom left of the screen. Tapping on the screenshot thumbnail will open the screenshot and you can access a wide range of editing tools. You can also share the screenshot directly with the help of the share button. It is also possible to draw on the screenshot with a pencil or pen and add text. Once finished, the final version of your screenshot can be saved to Photos app or Albums tab. 4. Troubleshooting Tips for Taking Screenshots Without Buttons If the screenshot didn’t seem to go through, try to press the buttons for a longer time, or until the screen flashes and you hear a shutter sound. Make sure your hand is not blocking the volume up or side button. You can also use AssistiveTouch to take screenshots with just a single tap. If your iPhone XR doesn’t detect any button presses, press down the Volume Up and Side buttons once more and immediately slide the lock button towards the volume button. Try to do the screenshot again in a well-lit area, so you can see it better. Check your screenshot in Albums tab / Photos app to make sure it was saved properly. Q1. What is a screenshot? A1.
