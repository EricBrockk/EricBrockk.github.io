Yes! Read on to discover 3 Easy Ways to Take Screenshots on iPhone XR Without Button! Are you looking for a way to take screenshot on your brand new iPhone XR without pressing any button? Taking screenshots on iPhone XR without button can be a difficult task to do especially for those who are not tech savvy. It can be done easily by following a few simple steps which are outlined in this article. Read on to find out three easy ways to take screenshot on iPhone XR without pressing any buttons.\n“Taking screenshots on iPhones can be tricky,” says Richard Smith, an Apple expert. “The iPhone XR in particular can pose some obstacles due to the fact that it doesn’t have a home button. But don’t worry, there are still several ways to take a screenshot without using the button.”\n“The easiest way to take a screenshot on an iPhone XR is by using the Side Button/Volume Up method,” according to Apple. “Simply press and hold the Side button on the right side of the device, and at the same time, press and release the Volume Up button. This will capture the current screen and store the screenshot in your Photos application.”\nAn additional way to capture your screen on an iPhone XR is by using the Assistive Touch function. “This method requires you to enable the Assistive Touch option in the Settings application,” says Smith. “Once enabled, a small circle icon will appear on your home screen which you can then tap to access additional functions. From here, you can tap the ‘Device’ menu, then select ‘More’ and finally ‘Screenshot’ to take a screenshot of your current screen.”\nUse AssistiveTouch.\nOne of the easiest ways to take screenshot on the iPhone XR is to use AssistiveTouch. This feature allows users to customize accessibility options for the device, including setting up gesture and button taps.

Tap it and select “Device” \u003e “More” \u003e “Screenshot”.\nUse Home and Power Button. This method works with all iPhone devices. To take a screenshot, press and hold the Home and Power button simultaneously. Continue holding until you hear the shutter sound and you will see a white screen flash. The screenshot will then be saved to your Photos app.\nUse Side Button and Volume Up Button.
